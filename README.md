# sql-reference
- The project entailed creating a simple json file to store sql commands with their syntactical patterns as key-value pairs.
- The file includes references for database, table, column, and row-level commands.
- This file was created in various git branches as a way of learning git commands and practices.
- Database and table have command references for create, drop, and alter.
- Row has commands for insert, update, and delete.
- Finally, column has commands for add, drop, rename, adding a primary key, and adding a foreign key.
